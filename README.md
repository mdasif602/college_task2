Getting Started:

Clone the Repository (Optional): If the code is publicly available on a platform like Github, you can clone it using the provided command:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/amaraj078/recipe-search-api.git
Use code with caution.

Project Setup: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

Bash
cd recipe-search-api
npm install
Use code with caution.

Environment Variables: Create a file named .env in the project root directory and configure the following variables (replace with your own values):

PORT: The port on which the server will run (default: 3000)
MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string (replace with your MongoDB connection details)
JWT_SECRET: A secret key used for generating JWT tokens (keep this secure)
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY: Your API key for Spoonacular or a similar recipe API
Start the Server: Run the following command to start the API:

Bash
npm start

This will typically start the server on http://localhost:5000.

Using the API:

User Management:
Use the /api/auth/signup endpoint to register a new account.
Use the /api/auth/login endpoint to log in and get a JWT token.
Authentication: Include the JWT token in the Authorization header for authenticated requests (format: Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>).
Recipe Search: Use a dedicated endpoint (e.g., /api/recipes/search) to search for recipes based on ingredients.
Favorites Management: Dedicated endpoints can manage adding and removing recipes from favorites.
View Favorites: Use an endpoint to retrieve your list of favorite recipes.
Postman Collection:

The project may offer a Postman collection for easy interaction with the API. You can import this collection into Postman for testing purposes.
